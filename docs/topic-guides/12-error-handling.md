# Error handling

## Introduction

This topic guide describes how errors should be handled that are generated by the Onegini React Native plugin. We will start by enumerating the plugin specific errors.

## Error codes

Every error has a code which uniquely identifies the error. The errors specific to Onegini React Native plugin are as follows:

### Android

    8001 - userProfileIsNull
    8002 - authenticatedUserProfileIsNull
    8003 - authenticatorIsNull
    8004 - registeredAuthenticatorsIsNull
    8005 - identityProvidersIsNull
    8006 - qrCodeNotHaveData
    8007 - methodToCallNotFound
    8008 - urlCantBeNull
    8009 - urlIsNotWebPath

### iOS

    8002 - userProfileIsNull
    8003 - registeredAuthenticatorsIsNull
    8004 - notRegisteredAuthenticatorsIsNull
    8005 - identityProvidersIsNull
    8006 - providedUrlIncorrect
    8007 - loginCanceled
    8008 - enrollmentFailed
    8009 - authenticationCancelled
    8010 - changingCancelled
    8011 - registrationCancelled
    8012 - cantHandleOTP
    8013 - incrorrectResourcesAccess
    8014 - authenticatorNotAvailable
    8015 - authenticatorNotRegistered
    8016 - authenticatorDeregistrationCancelled
    8017 - failedParseData
    8018 - responseIsNull
    400 - somethingWentWrong

Every error returns an object that contains a `code` and `description` property. These can provide helpful information on how to recover from or handle a given error.

## SDK error codes

As the Onegini React Native plugin is a wrapper for the Onegini Android and iOS SDKs, many errors that are returned come directly from the SDKs themselves. This is true for error codes in the ranges 9000 and higher.

These error codes are mostly consistent. However, there may be some small differences between the two platforms. See the error handling documentation for the [Android SDK](https://docs.onegini.com/android-sdk/topics/error-handling.html) and the [iOS SDK](https://docs.onegini.com/ios-sdk/topics/error-handling.html) for details. Both sets of documentation also include a helpful error map at the bottom of the page.
