# User registration

## Introduction

User registration is a fundamental part of the Onegini Mobile Security Platform. As developer you have a couple options to handle this process:

## Register by default browser

To start the user registration using WebView or browser you can `registerUser(identityProviderId: string | null): Promise<Types.Profile>` method. Calling this method will launch a browser where you need to register. If registration is successful, the browser will return a link that can be caught. After the registration process is completed, the method will return object of `RegistrationResponse`. This will mean that the user has successfully registered. 

#TODO: handle scopes
#TODO: browser types (Safari, WebView, External)
#TODO: handleRegistrationCallback

```
OneginiSdk.registerUser(providerId)
    .then(profile => {
        console.log('Registration success! ', profile);
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.error('Registration failed: ', err)
    })
```


## Choosing an identity provider

To select an identity provider which will be used during the registration process you need to pass its id in the place of the `identityProviderId` param. To choose an identity provider, first you need to get all available providers. Call the method `Onegini.instance.userClient.getRegisteredAuthenticators(context)` to get a list with available providers id. If this parameter isnâ€™t specified or if its value is `null` the default identity provider set on the **Token Server** will be used.
